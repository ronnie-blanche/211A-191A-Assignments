            <p>Hey y'all!! I'm Ronnie Blanche, but y'all can call me Ronnie if that's easier lol. I've just started my critical mapping journey by joining 191A, but 
                I really hope I'll be able to apply the skills we'll be learning in this class to uplift and support as many marginalized communtiies as I can.
                 As a member of the akphabet mafia (LGBTQ+ community for anyone who isn't familiar with tiktok lingo ^^), I definitely would be interested in 
                 learning how I can use GIS and data mapping to provide a voice to the members in my communtity that have had their voices taken away, stories erased, or identities subdued. </p>
